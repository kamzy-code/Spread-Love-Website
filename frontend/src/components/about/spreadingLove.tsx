            Spread Love Network was birthed and inspired through friendship.
            It's a brand that exists because a friend saw the possibilities and
            gifts of another and encouraged her to thread this path, as she had
            the ability to put smiles on people's faces.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg ">
            We started this journey on the 14th of February 2023, and officially
            launched as a brand on the 15th of March, 2023. Through the months,
            we've been able to celebrate and appreciate hundreds and thousands
            of people in and across the country.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg ">
            Today, we've helped thousands of people create unforgettable
            moments, proving that love knows no boundaries.
